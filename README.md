<h1 align="center">Search engine</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

This project is a system that allows users to find information on a website using specified keywords or phrases.
Search engines usually consist of three main components: indexer, search algorithm and user interface, but only the indexer and search algorithm have been implemented.

The <b>Indexer</b> is a part of the search engine that collects and stores data about web pages. The indexer follows links on web pages and adds new pages to the database. The indexer also analyzes the content of web pages and extracts lemmas from them.

The <b>Search Algorithm</b> is the part of the search engine that processes user queries and returns the most relevant results from the index.
